# Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-Satellite-Image-Masking-of-Sensitive-Areas
Satellite images are being extracted by Space organisations around the world. One of the objectives of the agencies is to mask out sensitive area for security reasons. For this purpose, there are certain predefined shapefiles in terms of Latitude and Longitude of earth. These shapefiles are to be used on the raw images that are not Geo-referenced and hence are ought to be handled in the co-ordinate axis (Scan-Pixels) . For this reason, a file that maps certain scan-pixels to latlons is provided so that one can project all the scanpixels to latlons and mask the area using shapefiles. This is specifically not opted as the product/satellite image has to dessiminated to users in the scan-pix. For this reason we propose machine learning techniques to accomplish this challenging task.
